4. If you had to create an index on these tables, which fields would you most
likely index, and why?

Whenever you are looking to add indexes to tables, the goal is to optimize fields that would be commonly searched against for retrieving data from the table

Given our structures for the tables we have in this assignment

Customers
-id
-name
-address
-phone_number
-email

Orders
-id
-customer_id
-order_amount
-order_address

We can probably assume that Customers.id and Orders.id are both indexed by probably being the primary keys for the table. If they aren't indexed, they would be prime targets for indexing

After taking care of the primary keys being indexed, we probably still want a few other fields of interest.

First we'll talk about Orders. Orders has a foreign key back to Customers via customer_id. Since this will probably be looked up against frequently, we should assign an index to it.

As for Customers, it mainly depends on the nature of the system. For example, if a person's login/identifier is something such as their phone_number or email, then I'd suggest adding an index to one of those fields

However, as it currently stands there's no information to suggest that that is the case, so I would add an index to name since name is a commonly searched on field in most systems.
